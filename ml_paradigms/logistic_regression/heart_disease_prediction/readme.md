This assignment guides you through building a classification model using logistic regression and other ML classifiers to predict the presence of heart disease. 
You will use the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to perform data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

Tasks to be done:
1. Read Dataset 
2. Understand key variables linked to heart disease using ploting corelation heatmap 
3. Perform some pre-processing steps like normalizing features (or any other relevant preprocessing). 
4. Diving Data into train and test sets. 
5. Applying atleast 3 classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, K-NN, Random Forest etc. 
6. Evaluate model performance (using plotting Confusion Matrix, and finding Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-score) 
7. Plot (bar chart) feature contribution towards Class prediction. 
8. Plot decision boundary for Logistic Regression.
